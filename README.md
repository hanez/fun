# Fun

Fun Uses Nothing - Life is too short not to code fun... ;)

Influenced by Bash, C, Go, Lua, Python and Rust.

## Idea

 * Simplicity
 * Consistency
 * Joy in coding
 * Fun!

## Characteristics

 * Static and optionally dynamic
 * No pointers
 * Type safety
 * Written in C / Internally no_camel_case... ;)

## The Fun Manifesto

Fun is a programming language built on a simple idea:
Coding should be enjoyable, elegant, and consistent.

### Philosophy

 - **Fun is Fun**<br>
   Programming should spark creativity, not frustration. Code in Fun feels light, playful, and rewarding.
 - **Fun Uses Nothing**<br>
   Minimalism is power. No unnecessary features, no endless syntax variations, no formatting debates. Just clean, uniform code.
 - **Indentation is Truth**<br>
   Two spaces, always. No tabs, no four-space wars. Code should look the same everywhere, from your laptop to /usr/bin/fun.
 - **One Way to Do It**<br>
   No clutter, no 15 ways of writing the same thing. Simplicity means clarity.
 - **Hackable by Nature**<br>
   Fun should be small and embeddable, like Lua. Easy to understand, extend, and tinker with — true to the hacker spirit.
 - **Beautiful Defaults**<br>
   A language that doesn’t need linters, formatters, or style guides. Beauty is built in.

### The Community

Fun is not about being the fastest or the most feature-rich. It’s about sharing joy in coding. The community should be:

 - Respectful
 - Curious
 - Creative

Like the name says: Fun Unites Nerds.

### The Goal

A language that feels like home for developers who:

 - Love minimal, elegant tools
 - Believe consistency is freedom
 - Want to write code that looks good and feels good

Fun may not change the world — but it will make programming a little more fun.
