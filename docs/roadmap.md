# Roadmap

This page outlines high-level areas of focus and points to places where you can help.

## Themes
- Developer experience: docs, examples, REPL polish
- Optional extensions: stabilize and document supported integrations
- Performance: steady improvements in hot paths and data structures
- Safety: clearer error messages, diagnostics, and sandboxing guidance

## Near-term
- Expand CLI reference and examples ([cli.md](./cli.md))
- Improve testing docs and coverage ([writing-tests.md](./writing-tests.md))
- Fill gaps in stdlib documentation ([stdlib.md](./stdlib.md))

## Medium-term
- Bytecode/reference updates as internals evolve ([bytecode-format.md](./bytecode-format.md), [internals.md](./internals.md))
- Embedding guides and host API stability ([embedding.md](./embedding.md), [rust.md](./rust.md))

## Contributing
See [contributing.md](./contributing.md) for how to propose and implement items. Track concrete tasks via repository issues and PRs.
