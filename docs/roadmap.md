# Roadmap

This page outlines high-level areas of focus and points to places where you can help.

## Themes
- Developer experience: docs, examples, REPL polish
- Optional extensions: stabilize and document supported integrations
- Performance: steady improvements in hot paths and data structures
- Safety: clearer error messages, diagnostics, and sandboxing guidance

## Near-term
- Expand CLI reference and examples (`docs/cli.md`)
- Improve testing docs and coverage (`docs/writing-tests.md`)
- Fill gaps in stdlib documentation (`docs/stdlib.md`)

## Medium-term
- Bytecode/reference updates as internals evolve (`docs/bytecode-format.md`, `docs/internals.md`)
- Embedding guides and host API stability (`docs/embedding.md`, `docs/rust.md`)

## Contributing
See `docs/contributing.md` for how to propose and implement items. Track concrete tasks via repository issues and PRs.
